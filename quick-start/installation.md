# ðŸ’¾ Installation

Now we need to install the [Scratch For Discord app](https://androz2091.github.io/scratch-for-discord/download/index.html), available on Andriod, Windows, Macintosh & Linux but is also available on any browser.

Once that has been downloaded and you have completed the setup, open the app up and as of right now the original version of S4D is not working we will need to use an official fork of the project. [https://deploy-preview-469--scratch-for-discord.netlify.app/](https://deploy-preview-469--scratch-for-discord.netlify.app), Click on the settings icon.\
