## Creating your bot application

First of all, you'll need to go and create an application at [https://discord.dev](https://discord.dev)\

You can name this application anything you would like, but I'll name mine S4D testing.\
You'll need to click on the bot tab & click the add bot button.

## Generating the bot's token

Now we have to get the bot's token because that is the most important piece of your bot!\

Click the copy button and put this in a safe place, I suggest making a temporary .txt on your computer with it.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Remember:** You need to keep this token a secret if a hacker gets ahold of

it, they could do terrible things with your bot!
{% endhint %}

## Inviting your bot

Now we need to click the OAuth2 tab and select URL Generator.\

Once on this page select bot then scroll down and select "Administrator". After this, there should be a link at the bot of the page which you can copy and paste into your browser URL.\

Once pasted in your browser select your server that you want the bot in then click the continue button. Now it will say the permissions, just click "Authorize".\
